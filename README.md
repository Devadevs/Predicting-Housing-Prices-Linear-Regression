# PredictingHousingPrices
Using Supervised Linear Regression modeling to predict housing prices based on data and feature extraction involving median housing prices and other parameters. This ML project focuses on discrete numerical data types in order to implement an accurate algorithm for predicting future housing prices given a specific training set. 

Fundamental prerequisites are as follows: end=''
    1.) must have relevant frameworks and libraries installed i.e. pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc end=''
    2.) Well-rounded grasp on Python programming and syntax end=''
    3.) this project uses basic OS and file handling procedures

Note: This is not nearly enough data to be implemented into the wild as this requires an enormous amount of data
    Still this is a rather useful and insightful project for implementing core Machine Learning strategies in practice

Enjoy :)
