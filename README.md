# Predicting Housing Prices

Using Supervised Linear Regression modeling to predict housing prices based on data and feature extraction involving median housing prices and other parameters. This ML project focuses on discrete numerical data types in order to implement an accurate algorithm for predicting future housing prices given a specific training set. 

Fundamental prerequisites are as follows: 
- Must have relevant frameworks and libraries installed i.e. pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
- Well-rounded grasp on Python programming and syntax 
- This project uses basic OS and file handling procedures

Note: This is not nearly enough data to be implemented into the wild as this requires an enormous amount of data. Still, this is a rather useful and insightful project for implementing core Machine Learning strategies in practice.

The code follows an iterative process of importing the primary housing data set using a functional method that invokes the OS module. 
It then follows that we use data extraction in Pandas to read in the csv file and use matplotlib to provide visual analysis. 

Featured plots include various histograms, bar graphs, and population density scatter plots that outline California. Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques allowed for dimensionality reduction as well as the extraction of useful insights from various indices. The Linear Regression algorithm was useful for fitting the data points with minimal error. Note that this is a relatively small dataset (20,000 indices). A much larger dataset with more columns would prove useful for better predictions.
